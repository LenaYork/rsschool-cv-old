		  <p>Greetings! Here is my short resume and my code example.</p>
		  <p>I've always been interested in computer science and now that I'm adult I'd like to finaly follow this desire of mine. <br>
		  Having been teaching English for many years I've realized how impoirtant the language is when it comes to learning,
		  especially learning programming. <br>
		  Knowing the language helps me a lot since there're so many decent courses and videos in English.<br> 
		  I love the process of coding and finding solutions. <br>
		  My enthusiasm, willing to learn new things and hopefully theoretical knowledge will help make my lack of experience a temporary thing.</p>

            <li><strong>html</strong></li>
            <li><strong>css</strong></li>

          <p>mostly with such libraries as <em>bootstrap</em> and <em>jQuery</em>. 
		  I also have basic knowledge of <em>PHP</em> and <em>SQL</em>.</p>
