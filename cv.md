I've always been interested in computer science and now that I'm adult I'd like to finaly follow this desire of mine. Having been teaching English for many years I've realized how impoirtant the language is when it comes to learning, especially learning programming. Knowing the language helps me a lot since there're so many decent courses and videos in English. I love the process of coding and finding solutions. My enthusiasm, willing to learn new things abd hopefully theoretical knowledge will help make my lack of experience a temporary thing.

Speaking about skills, I have been using:

- [x]  javascript,
- [x]  html
- [x]  css
mostly with such libraries as bootstrap and jQuery. I also have basic knowledge of PHP and SQL.

Here you can have a look at my code example: [Click!](https://github.com/LenaYork/hexal)

My coding experience includes:

1. Adding some scripts to websites.
2. Creating [an online shop]( http://littlecrown.ru/)
3. Creating [a Horoscope website](http://test.skillwood.by/horoscope/)

I graduated from BSTTU in 2013, got a bachelor degree as a psychologyst and an English teacher. I've been learning programming online:

* udemy courses ("Complete Web Developer Course" is still in process)
* html academy
* sololearn
*  and of course geekbrains üòè

My English level is Advanced I suppose since that's my major. I can communicate with people whether it's chatting or talking person-to-person, also can discuss a wide range of topics, watch movies, series and other videos without subs. No sertificates though.
